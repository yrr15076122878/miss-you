                        Major achievement:
" Two types of standardized battery boxes were developed, and the combination of the battery packs of the two boxes can cover the power demand of all pure electric buses of 6~18 meters. A bus power battery system with hydro-electric separation design and mechanic-electric-thermal composite safety design is developed. The specific energy of the battery system has reached 161.27Wh/kg, and the system integration efficiency is 89.6%. In the system monomer battery temperature 3 ℃ or less; Battery system cycle life is not less than 3000 times; The absolute value error of SOC and capacity estimation is not greater than 3%; Developed a 750V/800A quick charger, which can quickly charge the battery system to over 80% of SOC within 30 minutes; Battery system through the national standard of various safety tests, monomer heat out of control after the system no fire explosion time > 15 minutes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological innovation:
In order to solve the safety problems of power battery system caused by energy density increase and fast charging, and take into account the characteristics of long life and environmental adaptability, the integrated design of liquid cooling plate is realized, the cooling effect is significantly improved, the temperature distribution is more uniform and the safety is guaranteed. The high-strength and light-weight material box is studied, combined with the design concept of weakening module, on the basis of ensuring the structural safety. Enhance the energy density of the system.

An adaptive state estimation algorithm based on multi-time scale is proposed. The maximum available capacity of the power battery and the microscopic time scale are used to estimate the SOC of the power battery at macro time scale, which breaks through the state of strong coupling, strong time-varying, strong nonlinearity and multi-time scale. The estimation limit realizes the accurate estimation of multi-state and multi-time scale parallel decoupling. Under the condition that the initial value error of SOC is up to 30%, it can still converge to within 3% quickly. The estimated SOC and maximum available capacity estimation error are both in the Within 2%.

                        The increase in power density and efficiency as well as cost reduction of the motor drive system for vehicles is a world-wide problem, which is need to be breaked through urgently. The development of high power density automotive motor controllers by taking advantage of the high temperature, high efficiency and high frequency characteristics of silicon carbide (SiC) devices is considered to be the main solution. Support by the new energy vehicle project of National Key R&D Program, the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences led a research and development team consisting of thirteen units across the country to carry out "the study of basic theory and evaluation methods for SiC devices and systems for high temperature vehicles". To take full advantage of high temperature operation ability of SiC devices and develop high temperature converter systems, the team targets three scientific issues, which are carrier transport mechanism of high temperature SiC chip, multi-physical coupling mechanism of high temperature SiC module packaging, and electromagnetic interference generation and propagation mechanism of high temperature SiC motor controller. The team already breaks through some key technologies, such as carrier transport enhancing technology of SiC device, SiC planar double-sided cooled packaging technology and integration method of SiC motor controller. The team successfully designed and developed a prototype 100 kW SiC motor controller. Verified by authoritative testing organizations, the peak power density of the developed controller is over 37.1 kW/L, the maximum efficiency exceeds 98.6% at 30kHz. The power density, peak efficiency and high-efficiency operation zone of the motor controller was significantly improved. This work has accumulated competitive core technology and valuable R&D experience for China’s motor drive for new-energy vehicle.

                       Using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental research, the dynamic and static model including power device, temperature field model of film capacitor core, stray inductance model of capacitor and power device, busbar, motor winding, capacitor and power device are established. The electrical, magnetic, thermal and machine-related basic models of the motor drive controllers such as the ground capacitance model and the controller shell stress field model constitute the theoretical basis for the integrated design of the motor drive controller. In the SiC module, a three-phase 1200 V/300 A module containing 72 SiC chips has been developed, which is the SiC module with the largest number of chips and the highest integration in the published literature. In terms of passive components, a multi-function film capacitor with energy storage, power interconnection, heat dissipation, structural support and mechanical protection was designed and developed. Its ripple current absorption capability was improved by 47%~78%. In the aspect of motor drive controller, the decomposition design method "from system and component" is utilized to replace the assembly method "from component to system". Based on the optimal design goal of the controller, the package design requirements of each component are derived from the top of the controller. By breaking the boundary between passive components, electronic system components, heat sinks, and controller structural support components, the structural multiplexing of each component is realized, and the "system integration to guide component packaging" design method of the vehicle motor drive controller was initially established to maximize space utilization. The full SiC controller prototype EVC020 was developed. Its driving power is 85kW, the total volume 2.29L, and the highest efficiency 98.6%@30kHz. The high-efficiency area is 95%, which is 80% more than the silicon-based benchmark prototype. In terms of power density, a substantial improvement from 5 to 8 kW/L to 37.1 kW/L while maintaining high efficiency is realized. In the high-temperature operation research, the peak full-load power test with the inlet water temperature of 105 °C was passed. In the electromagnetic compatibility issue, the conducted emission at high-voltage DC port and the low-voltage power-supply port was tested under full-load operation condition, and complied with class 3 defined in CISPR25.

                      The high specific energy punch cell developed by Tianjin Lishen Battery Co., Ltd. is in the B-sample stage. The main parameters of the battery are as follows: the nominal capacity is >77Ah at the discharge current rate of 1/3C, and the charge and discharge interval is 4.2V-2.5V; the voltage platform is 3.63V; the specific energy is greater than 302Wh/kg; the volume ratio energy is larger than 660Wh/L, and the specific power is greater than 1300W/kg. The battery DC internal resistance is <1.5mΩ (the test condition: 50% SOC at 1C for 10s). The capacity retention is 90.3% after 754 cycles at room temperature and 1C charge/discharge, which is expected to reach 1500 cycles at the capacity retention of 80%. At 45 °C, the capacity retention is 87.0% after 567 cycles under 1C charge/discharge cycle with the trend up to 800 cycles at the capacity retention of 80%. For the discharge test at -20℃, the capacity represents 83.0% of that at room temperature. For the 3C rate discharge test, the capacity represents 92% of that at room temperature. The reversible recovery capacity after storage for 30 days at 60°C is 95.2%. With respect to the safety performance, the punch cell has met the standard of GB T31485-2015 in short circuit test, extrusion test, hot-box test, etc. all. The cell has been overcharged up to 100%SOC at the current rate of 1/3C without fire and explosion. The Li-ion battery shows the advantages of high specific energy, high performance and high safety. At present, Lishen is in a good collaboration with a number of domestic and foreign automobile manufactures and drone R&D companies. This type of Li-ion battery is expected to be in mass production by the end of 2020 and assembled into EVs in 2021.

                        We are focusing on the frontiers of the fundamental knowledge in Li-ion battery, and the cut-edge technologies and its application. In order to successfully realize the mass production of high-performance and high-safety Li-ion power batteries with specific energy >300Wh/kg, the main technical innovations are shown as follows.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.High nickel cathode material with high specific capacity is used in this project. The surface modification of this material will stabilize the material/electrolyte interface, which can enhance the resistance of the material to moisture and carbon dioxide, and also suppress the gas production. This technology can greatly prolong the cycle life and high temperature performance.
                        <br>
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.A silicon-carbon composite anode material is used. By adjusting the ratio of the anode and optimizing the electrode fabrication process, it is possible to effectively avoid significant volume change and pulverization of the electrode during the process of intercalation and deintercalation lithium, so as to solve the problem of rapid capacity loss due to anode degradation;
                        <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.New electrolyte development technology. The self-developed lithium salt with high conductivity, good thermal stability and low cost, combined with new solvents and additives, forms a SEI film with low impedance and good stability on the surface of the cathode and anode materials.

                      With "two-layer security protection technology for new energy vehicles", TGOOD has established 19 safety models for charging network big data, for the first time breaking the traditional concept that the safety of EV batteries depend entirely on BMS control. TGOOD is the first company in the world, who has not only proposed but also implemented the redundant safety protection of power cells by charging power grids. The scope of protection has been extended to the charging side, the energy side, and the user side, and in terms of time extension of battery lifecycle has been realized. A multi-angle, multi-dimensional, systematic electric vehicle charging safety model is constructed, and the learning and evolution of large data in the cloud are carried out, so that the charging process and car safety hazards can be monitored, early warned, controllable, and traceable.

                       Based on the scientific big data model, with the active protection of new energy vehicles and the big data monitoring, TGOOD has developed and established a two-layer security protection system: active protection from CMS (flexible intelligent Charging Management System) and the big data security protection system.
                        <br>
                        CMS Active Protection System: TGOOD has established 11 protection models against charging voltage mismatch, controller communication failure, battery overheating, battery low temperature, battery temperature abnormity, and battery overcharging for each charging process, which will be monitored, analyzed and safety assessed in 27 dimensions. While the BMS (Battery Management System) controls the charging behavior of the vehicle, the CMS will perform double check. When an abnormity is found, active protection will start to terminate the charging task in time to protect the safety of the vehicle.
                        <br>
                       Big data security protection system: it is a second-tier security protection system established above CMS and based on big data, covering 8 types of protection models. Each charging data will be calculated and analyzed on the big data platform through 19 models with two layers of protection. If the threshold value for protection is reached, charging process will be stopped. In this way, the safety of each EV can be scored, safety hazards of the battery can be accurately identified and warned, also the battery health status and lifespan can be accurately predicted.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The module is packaged in half-bridge mode combing NTC and ALN ceramic substrate. Transfer molding in integration modules do not need any other external protection. Isolating vibration and moisture by molding material offer safer space for modules. On the other hand, modules can be extended capability for cycle test with low thermal-expansion coefficient, hard package materials. As for technological aspects, highly powerful process control capability guaranteed that the height between two substrates during process of double-side welding is under control continuously and no damage for electrical performance can be caused during transfer-molding process. The thermal resistance can reduce by about 30% with doubled-sided welding chips. Also, package density and power density are increased. T_j is about 150℃ and T_jmax is about 175℃. The doubled-sided heat dissipation structural design makes sure that modules can work properly within limited installation space.

It has high frequency, high voltage, high current, easy switching and other excellent performance. It is praised as the "CPU" of power converter device in the industry, and is widely used in electric power. In the car. Due to the limitation of material properties, IGBT power devices can only work in environments below 200 °C, which cannot meet the requirements of modern electronic technology for high temperature, high frequency, high voltage and radiation resistant devices. As a representative of the third-generation wide bandgap semiconductor material, silicon carbide (SiC) single crystal material has the properties of large band gap, high thermal conductivity, high electron saturation migration rate, etc., which can realize the specific power of the motor by greatly increasing the rotational speed of the motor. Increased, its frequency and efficiency can be very high, the volume can be very small, about 70-80% less than the current IGBT. Silicon carbide devices are used in the Tesla Model3 controller.
